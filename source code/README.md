# ReCDroid Source Code
RecDroid provides two versions to support different android SDK versions.

If android sdk>=6.0, please use uiautomator version.

If android sdk<6.0, please use robotium version.

The reason why we use different versions is that Android has different internal storge policy between sdk>=6.0 and sdk<6.0.
